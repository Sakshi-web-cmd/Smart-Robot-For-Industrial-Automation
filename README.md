## Features

1. *Obstacle Detection and Avoidance*  
   - Uses *ultrasonic sensors* to detect obstacles.  
   - Automatically navigates around objects to prevent collisions.

2. *Fire Detection and Pumping*  
   - Equipped with a *flame sensor* to detect fire.  
   - Activates a *water pump* to extinguish small fires.

3. *Bluetooth Control*  
   - Allows remote control via a *Bluetooth module*.  
   - Enables manual navigation and task execution.

4. *Voice Command Control*  
   - Supports *voice commands* through Bluetooth.  
   - Provides hands-free operation.
